Bonjour! For now, I'm experiencing an exciting journey as an intern researcher at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).

- ðŸ’¬ I'm an M.Sc student at Nanjing University.

- ðŸ”­ My research interests are device-free and wireless sensing. I also do some fun things about LLM. If you have any interesting ideas, please feel free to contact me.

- ðŸ˜„ I had a wonderful intern experience in Bytedance. I'm also the teaching assistant for computer architecture in Nanjing University's 2023 Spring semester.
